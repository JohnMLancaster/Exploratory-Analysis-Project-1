## Exploratory Analysis Class Project Week #1
================================================================


This is a repository of files for the class project for Week #1
We will be creating four R scripts which will make and save 4 plots from the Household Electric Power COnsumption dataset

## Student/Author:  
  John Lancaster

## Data Source:   
  UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository   
  for machine learning datasets


## Plots to be Produced
1) Histogram of Global Active power
2) Global Active Power as a function of day of week & time of  
   day
3) Energy Sub Metering as a function of day of week & time of 
   day
4) Panel Plot with Plot #2, Plot #3, Voltage vs Datetime, Global 
   Reactive Power vs datetime


## Contents of the Repo
1) README.MD
2) DATABOOK.MD
3) Instructions for Executing Assignment R Scripts.RMD
4) R scripts: plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R
5) R script outpus: plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, plot4.png


## Instructions for executing the R scripts
THese instructions are also available in the included markdown file: "Instructions for Executing Assignment R Scripts.RMD"

Each of the four R scripts for Assignement #1 reside in the repo you just downloaded from GitHub.

To execute these R scripts you will need to follow the following steps.

  Let  Rscript == the R script you want to execute (plot1,  
  plot2, plot3, plot4).
  
  
  STEP 1: Fork the repo and make a local copy on your computer
          prior to executing any of the scripts.
          Record the directory path to the repo.
          This only has to be done once. It is not necessary to
          do this for each execution.
  
  STEP 2: Open Rscript (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, or plot4.R)
          in your local repo copy. 

  STEP 3: Edit the directory path listed in the first line to
          the path of your local repo copy.
          The line in the original R script reads:
          workdir <- "C:/Users/John Lancaster/Desktop/Coursera/
                      Exploratory Analysis/Week 1 Assignment/
                      repo"
          Change the right hand side by copying in your path.
          
  STEP 4: Save and close the editted Rscript file in your local       
          repo copy.
  
  STEP 5: Open RStudio.
  
  STEP 6: On the Menu Bar at the top of your RStudio session 
          open the CODE dropdown list and select SOURCE.
          Click on SOURCE this will open a dialogue for 
          selecting the R script you wish to execute.
          
  STEP 7: Navigate to your local repo copy and select the script   
          you wish to execute, Rscript. Click on it.
          This will execute Rscript. Upon successful execution 
          you will see the plot displayed in your session's 
          PLOTS window. The plot will also have been copied to 
          your copy of repo.
          
  STEP 8: Repeat this STEP 2 through STEP 7 for each plot in the
          assignment.
